LinkToShow
==========

We often need to display one link if a model instance meets a certain condition, and display another if the model fails that condition. A good example is when you want to display a link to a model on it's edit form to the 'show' action. If the model is active, then let's provide a link to the public show action (/products/1). If it's inactive (!@product.active), then let's provide a link to another action (maybe /admin/products/1).


Example
=======

link_to_show(@product, :condition => @product.active)
